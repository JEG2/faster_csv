= To Do List

The following is a list of planned expansions for FasterCSV, in no particular
order.

  * I'm using FasterCSV to parse CSV files from different sources, and
    occasionally the source (which I don't control) outputs
    a blank line.

    When doing "FasterCSV.foreach(file, :headers => :first_row) do |row|" the
    "row" variable will become an Array object when it encounters a blank line. 
    Within the loop I do something like "next if
    row.respond_to?(:empty?) && row.empty?" to skip the row if its blank, but I
    think of this more as a hack.

    It would be nice if FasterCSV.foreach would skip over the row instead of
    instantiating an Array object.

    Thanks,
